# MySQL

MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system. It is widely used in web applications and other types of software to store and manage data.

## Basic Usage

Once MySQL is installed and running, you can use it to create databases and tables, insert and retrieve data, and perform other database-related tasks. Here are some basic commands to get you started:

- To log in to the MySQL server as the root user, use the following command:

```
mysql -u root -p
```

You will be prompted to enter the root password that you set during installation.

- To create a new database, use the following command:

```
CREATE DATABASE dbname;
```

Replace `dbname` with the name of your database.

- To create a new table, use the following command:

```
CREATE TABLE tablename (
  column1 datatype,
  column2 datatype,
  column3 datatype
);
```

Replace `tablename` with the name of your table, and specify the names and data types of your columns.

- To insert data into a table, use the following command:

```
INSERT INTO tablename (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
```

Replace `tablename`, `column1`, `column2`, `column3`, `value1`, `value2`, and `value3` with the appropriate values.

- To retrieve data from a table, use the following command:

```
SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM tablename;
```

Replace `column1`, `column2`, `column3`, and `tablename` with the appropriate values.

These are just a few examples of the many commands and features available in MySQL. For more information, refer to the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/).
